- #### This directory contains demos for some of the key scripts in this repository. The folder name is the same as the script name. 
    Other scripts do not have demo provided because (1) it needs to run on a super computer or (2) it requires to read a large amount of data produced by previous simulations. For these scripts, please contact us if you want to check your outputs or you need our original data to test.
- #### Each folder contains the following subdirectories:

    | Directory | Contents |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | input/ | All required input files for this demo, excpet for the scripts. |
    | output/ | All output files/data by runing this script. |

    - A log file is presented in each folder, containing the command used to run this demo (followed by `>`) and the terminal outputs.

    - All Demos should be run in the `input/` folder.

    - A README file is presented in each folder, containing the link to the source code.

    - The run time for these demos, except for `opt_nscal`, should be within one day on a normal desktop. `opt_nscal` will take about 11 days.

- #### `input_data.tar.bz2` is the compressed file of all the input data that were used to perform the simulations in our paper *How synonymous mutations alter enzyme structure and function over long time scales*. Check the README files inside to learn more details.
