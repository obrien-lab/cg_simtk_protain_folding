### This directory contains demos for some of the key scripts in this repository. The folder name is the same as the script name.
### Each folder contains the following subdirectories:

| Directory | Contents |
| ------ | ------ |
| input/ | All required input files for this demo, excpet for the scripts. |
| output/ | All output files/data by runing this script. |

##### A log file is presented in each folder, containing the command used to run this demo (followed by `>`) and the terminal outputs.
##### The run time for these demos, except for `opt_nscal`, should be within one day on a normal desktop. `opt_nscal` will take about 11 days.

### `input_data.tar.bz2` is the compressed file of all the input data that were used to performed the simulations in our paper *How synonymous mutations alter enzyme structure and function over long time scales*. Check the README files inside to learn more details.
